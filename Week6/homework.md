1. SPA Homework
You will be following the steps laid out in Section 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 to "convert" your Capstone to a Single Page Application. Building out the file structure is only part of this homework, there should be zero empty files!

As a reminder, here are links to those steps:

Section 6.1 Section 6.2 Section 6.3 Activity 1 Section 6.3 Activity 2

As another reminder, do not forget to install the various packages even if they are not listed the steps of the activities (i.e. navigo and lodash).

In your capstone repo create the folder structure for an SPA -- components, views, and store.

Add files for components that would be repeated on each page/view of your capstone -- Header, Nav, Main, and Footer

Add a file for each page in your capstone in views and store

Remember to build your aggregators (index.js) in components, views, and store

Install the required npm packages

Below is an example of what the file structure could possibly look like (Ignore anything that was not covered in class. This is only an example and might not match what you've seen in class.):

3. API Research
If you have not started looking for a 3rd party API to use with your Capstone, please start looking. Below are a couple of links to help you start looking:

Find an API online from which you can consume data into your project (like the weather app, Google maps, or WebMD etc.) EG:- Collection of Free Public APIs
There is also a list of APIs that can be found in the Addendum of ResourcesWeek 6 Homework and Goals
