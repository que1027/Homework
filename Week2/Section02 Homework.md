Homework is due to your TA by the end of day (EOD) each Sunday
As shown in class, you will be creating and submitting a Jira ticket in order to submit your homework.


Set-up your Capstone repo on GitHub
NOTE: If you have already created your Capstone repository for the Week 1 Homework, you do not need to create another! Just create your homework repo as shown below.

If you have NOT done so, you'll need to follow these instructions twice:

once to create your capstone repo; you can just name it "Capstone" if you like
then a second time as described below to create your homework repo
Use the Savvy-Coders Starter template repo to create a new GitHub repo for your homework on your own account - name it Homework
Clone the repo to your machine. Don't forget to git add all of your work, git commit it with a message, and push it up to your remote repo again when you're done working!


Markdown Language Homework
Watch this video to learn more about Markdown

  Click on the file named README.md in the homework repo you just created.
  Delete all of the text currently populating the page.
  This is a Markdown Language file. In it:
  Write your name in a large font
  Write a subheading about you in a smaller font
  Create a list that explains your goals for this course

Pizza Place Homework
  Open the new homework directory in VS Code and create a new directory named "Week2" and then within that directory, create a JavaScript file - name it something that indicates it is homework for Week 2
  Inside your JS file, create two variables: pizzaPlace and numberOfToppings
  Have the variables reference the name of your Pizza Place and the number of toppings your Pizza Place offers.
  Print the variables and their types.
  Print a template literal that uses both variables to construct a short sentence about your Pizza Place.
  Construct an if statement that prints "Quality, not quantity." if you offer less than 10 toppings, or "A whole lot of pizza." if you offer 10 or more toppings.
  Add, commit, and push your JS file to your GitHub repo.
  WHEN FINISHED: Send your TA a message to let them know it's complete and make sure that your Jira ticket for homework submission includes a link to your GitHub Homework.
  Bonus Challenge
  Use a loop to print all of the even numbers from 1 to numberOfToppings (or 10)
An example of the output you want for in this assignment is:

The House of Pizza string
8 number
At The House of Pizza, we have 8 toppings.
Quality, not quantity.
